In 2019, Jason Miller created a blog post entitled ["Application Holotypes: A Guide to Architecture Decisions"](https://jasonformat.com/application-holotypes/), wherein he describes several "Holotypes," or broad categories of web apps, that fit under a shared architecture.

While I largely agree with what he laid out, I think there are a few missing holotypes or categories I might breakdown a bit more granularly. Additionally, I think there's room to be more specific about the "Ideal Implementation" and "Ideal Delivery" sections for each holotype, especially when you're focused on architectures for a single framework and not trying to describe architecture for the web landscape as a whole.

Below, I've enumerated the web app holotypes, as I see them, and some specific notes about the ideal implementation and delivery of them when using the Lo-Fi Stack to build a holotype of that kind.

### Information Manager

-   **Holotype**: Gmail
-   **Examples**: Google Calendar, Outlook.com, Fastmail
-   **Characteristics**: thick-client, infinite lists, embedded content, rich text editing, sanitization, MDI, storage, offline & sync, notifications
-   **Constraints**: extended session length, sensitive & largely uncacheable data, high security risk, often offline
-   **Ideal Implementation**: `???`
-   **Ideal Delivery**: PWA in standalone display mode.
