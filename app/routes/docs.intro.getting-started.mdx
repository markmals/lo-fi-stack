The Lo-Fi Stack is the easiest way to get a new web app or website with good developer experience & (more importantly) good user experience up and running quickly.

Taking inspiration from [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine), Lo-Fi Stack is strongly opinionated, with conventions and solutions for the most common problems web apps face, designed to relieve you — the developer — from needing to make unnecessary choices.
